# Unsaid

**Unsaid** is an anonymous, trauma-informed support platform designed for people who want to share their thoughts and emotions without judgment, labels, or exposure of identity.

It provides a moderated, text-only community space combined with structured peer conversations and access to verified mental health professionals—while explicitly preventing emotional dependency and unsafe dynamics.

---

## Overview

In many regions, especially India, individuals avoid sharing emotional struggles due to stigma, fear of judgment, or lack of privacy. Unsaid addresses this gap by offering a calm, anonymous, and safety-first environment for expression and support.

Unsaid is **not a crisis service** and does not replace professional medical or psychological care.
