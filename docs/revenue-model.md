# Unsaid

## Revenue Model (Anonymity-First)

### Core Constraint

Unsaid **does not collect or verify real-world user identities**.
Therefore:

* No KYC for end users
* No identity-based ad targeting
* No sale of user data
* No behavior profiling beyond safety and moderation needs

---

## Primary Revenue Streams (Recommended)

### 1. Professional-Led Group Sessions (Primary Revenue)

**Model:** Pay-per-session or subscription access
**Who pays:** Users (anonymously)

**How it works:**

* Verified professionals (therapists, counselors) host:

  * Group sessions
  * Topic-based workshops
  * AMA-style discussions
* Users join anonymously
* Payment is for *access*, not identity

**Privacy-preserving implementation:**

* Payment handled via third-party gateway
* Unsaid stores **transaction tokens only**, not personal identity
* No linking of session participation to user profiles

**Why this works:**

* High trust
* Clear value
* No dependency on user identity
* Common and accepted in India

---

### 2. Anonymous Subscriptions (Platform Access)

**Model:** Monthly or quarterly subscription

**Unlocks:**

* Access to professional sessions
* Advanced reflection tools
* Priority access to moderated rooms

**Key point:**
Subscription is tied to an **anonymous account token**, not a person.

---

### 3. Sponsored Wellness Programs (Non-Targeted)

**Model:** Brand sponsorship of neutral content

**Examples:**

* “Burnout Awareness Week”
* “Managing Work Stress” series
* “Sleep & Routine Reset”

**Rules:**

* No user targeting
* No data sharing
* Sponsor has no access to user interactions

**Acceptable sponsors:**

* Mental health organizations
* Wellness brands
* Universities, NGOs, corporates (CSR)

---

### 4. Institutional Partnerships (B2B2C)

**Model:** Licensing access for groups

**Clients:**

* Universities
* Corporates
* NGOs

**How it works:**

* Institution pays for access
* Users remain anonymous
* Institution receives **aggregate, non-identifiable metrics only**

**Examples of metrics shared:**

* Session attendance counts
* Topic popularity
* Time-of-day usage

---

## Secondary / Optional Revenue Streams

### 5. One-Time Paid Experiences

* Guided journaling challenges
* Time-limited support programs
* Expert-led workshops

No user history or identity needed.

---

### 6. Donations / Pay-What-You-Can

* Optional tipping to support the platform
* No visibility of donor identity to community or moderators

---

## Revenue Streams to Explicitly Avoid

These conflict with anonymity and safety.

* Advertising based on user behavior
* Selling insights or data
* Identity verification upsells
* 1:1 paid peer chats
* “Influencer” or popularity-based monetization

---

## Payment & Privacy Architecture (India-Ready)

* Use UPI / Cards via trusted gateway
* Store:

  * Payment status (success/failure)
  * Anonymous transaction reference
* Do NOT store:

  * Names
  * Phone numbers
  * Email addresses (unless optional and separated)

---

## Why This Model Is Sustainable

* Revenue aligns with **help**, not engagement addiction
* No incentive to increase emotional distress
* Trust becomes the growth engine
* Scales without regulatory or ethical friction

---

## Professional Opinion

An anonymity-first mental health platform **should never monetize attention, vulnerability, or identity**.

Unsaid’s strongest long-term revenue is:

> **Paid access to professional structure, not personal exposure.**
