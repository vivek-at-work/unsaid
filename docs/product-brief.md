## 1. Product Overview

**Unsaid** is an anonymous, moderated emotional support platform designed for individuals who want to share personal thoughts and feelings without judgment, labels, or exposure of identity.

The platform combines:

* Anonymous peer-based community support
* Structured, time-bound conversations
* Access to verified mental health professionals

Unsaid is built on trauma-informed principles and explicitly avoids features that create emotional dependency, exploitation, or unsafe “trauma bonding” dynamics.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

In India, mental and emotional distress is significantly underreported due to:

* Social stigma
* Fear of judgment
* Concerns around privacy and identity exposure
* Limited access to affordable professional care

Existing solutions tend to be either:

* Fully clinical (high barrier to entry), or
* Unmoderated communities that risk harm, manipulation, or dependency

There is a clear need for a **safe, anonymous, and non-clinical entry point** for emotional expression and support.
